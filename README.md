# File-Encryption-Decryption-Tool-Python
Developed a simple yet powerful encryption tool using Python. The program allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt any file using a custom or default key.
Features:
• Encrypts files using a user-provided or auto-generated key
• Decrypts encrypted files using the same key
• Handles text and data files securely
• Simple command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction

Key Concepts:
File handling | Encryption | Decryption | Python CLI | Security Practices

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of data confidentiality and symmetric encryption in Python.
